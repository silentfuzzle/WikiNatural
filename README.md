# WikiNatural
WikiNatural, the brain child of Adam McManigal, retrieves Wikipedia pages and displays them on panels in a 3D environment. In theory, users should be able to find the information they're looking for faster because WikiNatural spreads it over the X- and Y-plane as opposed to displaying it all on a single, long page. The application also has a map that tracks what pages you've visited and in what order.

This was my capstone project as an undergraduate Computer Science student. I co-developed it with Adam McManigal and Kyle Doyle at the University of Montana in 2013. At the time, we called it Natural Web, but it seems that name is quite common, so I'm renaming it here. Primarily, I worked on the map layout, panel layout, user interface controls, and animations.
